# Module-2-Challenge

## Description
The **Advanced-CSS-Portfolio** project is the second homework assignment of the March 2021 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

Building a benchmark for our future career as a web developer, this project focuses on applying recently learned core skills with advanced CSS. Built for ourselves and potential employers, this project contains a portfolio gallery of my most recent GitHub deployed repositories, a short story about myself, social media links, and contact information.

This project is for an employer to review samples of work and assess my candidacy for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, 
their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
